# RovPy

Starting code from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46506850/how-can-i-get-input-from-an-xbox-one-controller-in-python which in turn uses code from https://github.com/kevinhughes27/TensorKart. All necessary copyright notices have been kept.

## File Hierarchy

- gamepad.py: the python file which houses the code for receiving gamepad events
- main.py: the main script to execute. Currently it just fetches all of the inputs then waits .25 seconds and does it again.
